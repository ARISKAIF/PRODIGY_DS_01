# PRODIGY INFOTECH DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK 1:
Welcome to submission for task 1 of the Data Science Internship at [Prodigy Infotech](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech)
This project focuses on visualizing population data by creating both a bar chart and a histogram to represent the distribution of categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook explores gender distribution through a bar chart and age distribution through a histogram.
The aim is to provide clear visual insights into demographic patterns, serving as a foundational exercise in data analysis and visualization techniques.
