# PRODIGY_DS_01
# 🚀 Task-01: Data Visualization – Prodigy InfoTech Internship

📌 Objective
This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. The task involves creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender, in a population dataset. The goal is to represent data patterns and distributions visually for better interpretation.

📂 Task Description
> Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

🗂️ Dataset Used
Dataset Source: [Prodigy InfoTech](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech) - Task 1 Dataset
Type: Population data (CSV format)
Sample Variables: Age, Gender

📊 Data Visualization
Bar Chart: To show the count of each gender in the population
Histogram: To show the distribution of ages
Tools Used: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Insights:
Age groups most represented in the dataset
Gender distribution pattern

📈 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

✅ Results & Conclusion
The visualizations made it easier to understand how values like age and gender are distributed in the dataset. It provided a clear view of data spread and frequency, which is useful for further analysis and decision-making.
